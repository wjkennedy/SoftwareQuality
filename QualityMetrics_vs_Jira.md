*This table provides a high-level overview of each metric, along with how it might relate to CSAT and the Bug SLA, and how it could be implemented in Jira. The actual relationships and implementations can depend on many factors and might need to be analyzed in more detail:*

----

| Metric | Description | Relationship with CSAT | Relationship with Bug SLA | Jira Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Operational Measures | Monitor computer utilization, downtime, and response time. | Not directly related to CSAT. | Not directly related to Bug SLA. | System monitoring tools and Jira Service Management for incident management. |
| Ongoing Project Measures | Monthly status reports on milestones or planned vs. actual expenditures. | Not directly related to CSAT. | Can help meet Bug SLA by tracking project progress. | Jira Software with issues representing milestones and custom fields for expenditures. |
| Production Library and Backlog Measures | Full production library and backlog study. | Not directly related to CSAT. | Can help meet Bug SLA by managing the product backlog. | Jira Software for backlog management and version control systems for the production library. |
| User Satisfaction Measures | Measurement of user satisfaction. | Directly related to CSAT. | Meeting the Bug SLA can lead to higher CSAT. | Jira Service Management for CSAT surveys and user interviews. |
| Completed Project Measures | Counting the function point totals of completed projects and accumulating resource data. | Not directly related to CSAT. | Can help meet Bug SLA by tracking completed projects. | Jira Software for tracking completed issues and projects, and plugins like Advanced Roadmaps for function point analysis. |
| Soft-Factor Measures | In-depth survey of all the soft factors that influence software projects. | Can indirectly affect CSAT by improving software development processes. | Can help meet Bug SLA by improving software development processes. | Combination of tools, including Jira for tracking tool usage, and possibly surveys or other data collection methods for other factors. |
| Software Defect Measures | Measurement of software defect rates. | There is a strong observed correlation between defect levels and user satisfaction. | Can help meet Bug SLA by tracking and reducing defect rates. | Jira Software for tracking defects, and plugins like Jira Misc Workflow Extensions for calculating defect rates. |
| Enterprise Demographic Measures | Annual demographic surveys of employees in relevant skill classes. | Can indirectly affect CSAT by improving workforce planning. | Not directly related to Bug SLA. | Likely requires a separate HR system, though some information could be gathered from Jira user profiles. |
| Enterprise Opinion Survey | Survey of employee opinions. | Can indirectly affect CSAT by improving employee satisfaction. | Not directly related to Bug SLA. | Likely requires a separate survey tool, though Jira Service Management could be used for gathering some feedback. |
| Defect Escape Rate (DER) | The percentage of defects that have escaped into production compared to the total number of defects found. | High DER might lead to lower CSAT as more defects are reaching the customer. | High DER might indicate that the SLA for bug detection is not being met. | Jira Software for tracking defects and calculating DER. |
| Mean Time to Acknowledge (MTTA) | The average time it takes for a team to acknowledge that a bug or issue has been reported. | Faster MTTA can lead to higher CSAT as customers see their issues being acknowledged quickly. | MTTA is often a part of the Bug SLA, so meeting the MTTA target helps meet the SLA. | Jira Software for tracking issue creation and acknowledgement times. |
| Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) | The average time it takes for a team to resolve a bug or issue after it has been reported. | Faster MTTR can lead to higher CSAT as issues are resolved quickly. | MTTR is often a part of the Bug SLA, so meeting the MTTR target helps meet the SLA. | Jira Software for tracking issue creation and resolution times. |
| Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) | The average time between the occurrence of one failure and the occurrence of the next failure. | Higher MTBF can lead to higher CSAT as it indicates more reliable software. | MTBF might not directly relate to the Bug SLA, but it can indicate the effectiveness of the bug resolution process. | Jira Software for tracking issue resolution times. |
| Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT) | A measure of customer satisfaction with a product or service. | CSAT is the metric being optimized. | Meeting the Bug SLA can lead to higher CSAT. | Jira Service Management for CSAT surveys. |
| Bug SLA Compliance Rate | The percentage of bugs for which the SLA was met. | Higher SLA compliance can lead to higher CSAT as it indicates that issues are being resolved in a timely manner. | This is a measure of how well the team is meeting the Bug SLA. | Jira Service Management for tracking SLA compliance. |
| Defect Removal Efficiency (DRE) | The percentage of defects that are caught during the testing phase as opposed to being found in production. | Higher DRE can lead to higher CSAT as it indicates that fewer defects are reaching the customer. | Higher DRE might indicate that the SLA for bug detection is being met. | Jira Software for tracking defects and calculating DRE. |
