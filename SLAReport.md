# SLA Meet Rates and Bug Resolution in Online Retail
### William Kennedy, A9 Group, Inc.

Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are critical components of the relationship between a service provider and its customers. They define the standard of service expected by the customer and are often used as a measure of the service provider's performance. However, actual SLA meet rates are often not publicly disclosed by companies, making it challenging to assess their performance accurately.

In the context of online retail, one key aspect of SLAs is the resolution of bugs. A "bug" can refer to any disruption or unexpected event that negatively impacts the customer's experience or prevents them from achieving their intended objective. This could include website errors, payment processing issues, or problems with product functionality. In the context of software development and IT, a "bug" is a term used to describe an error, flaw, failure, or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. Bugs can range from minor display issues to severe security vulnerabilities.

## SLA and Bug Resolution Information

Our research into the SLAs and bug resolution practices of several online retail companies revealed a lack of publicly available data. Companies often do not disclose specific details about their SLAs or their performance against these SLAs. Furthermore, information about bug resolution practices is often not publicly disclosed, making it difficult to assess companies' performance in this area.

However, we were able to gather some information about the bug resolution practices of several companies from customer reviews and feedback. While this information is not a direct measure of the companies' SLAs or bug resolution practices, it provides some insight into their performance in these areas.

## Bug Bounty Programs

Many companies, including online retailers, run bug bounty programs to encourage the discovery and reporting of vulnerabilities in their systems. These programs offer financial rewards for the discovery and disclosure of bugs, effectively turning bug discovery into a competitive market. The scope of these programs varies, and they may not all include customer-reported bugs. The "safe harbor" term refers to legal protections for researchers who discover and report vulnerabilities in good faith.
